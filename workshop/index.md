# Materials Project Workshop 2020 (July 28 - 30)

The Materials Project Workshop is two-day interactive workshop to learn to use th Materials Project (MP) open-source tools. Topics will include basic structure manipulation, querying data from MP using the API, automating DFT calculations, exploring new chemical systems and machine learning. A optional one-day python and MongoDB primer is provided for anyone new to python programming and using databases. We'll also provide a virtual poster-session for anyone interested in networking with other participants.

## Registration
