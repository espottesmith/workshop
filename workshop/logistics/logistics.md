## Before the Workshop

### Virtual Poster-Session

We'll host a virtual poster-session via a YouTube video for lightning summaries and a FigShare repository with associated DOI for citation. Please [email](mailto:shyamd@lbl.gov):

- your poster PDF
- a 1-minute lighting video explaining the main concept behind your poster. This shouldn't be detailed summary of your work, but rather a high-level description that everyone can listen to and then decide which posters they want to focus on such as an elevator-pitch.

We'll host the lightning-videos on our YouTube Channel and publish the PDFs on FigShare with a DOI that everyone can cite for this poster session.

### Setup Instructions

1. [Sign in](https://materialsproject.org/) to your MP account online. Register for an account first if needed.
2. [Sign in](https://cocalc.org) to an account on CoCalc using the same email address you registered with. This will be the online python service we'll use to work interactively. If you don't use the email you registered for the workshop with to register on CoCalc.com, please send me an [email](mailto:shyamd@lbl.gov) so that I know. We'll use CoCalc as an interactive python environment where you can code alongside the lessons, work on exercises, and get live-help and feedback from our helpers. 

### Lesson Format

1. Lessons will be broadcast via Zoom with live audio + screencast from the instructor. You won't need a microphone or camera. Please make sure audio works via Zoom. 
2. We'll use CoCalc for all our collaborative work. An in-notebook chat will allow attendees to ask for help. Instructors and helpers will be able 
3. We'll set up a Slack channel for group chat. This will allow attendees to ask general questions and chat amongst each other as well.

#### Finding your API Key:

An important aspect of the Materials Project API is the use of API keys to ensure we can control the amount of traffic that comes to the API. Otherwise, it's very easy for someone to take down the MP servers, making them unavailable for anyone. Your API key can be accessed via the Dashboard:

1. Login to your Materials Project account and find the dashboard in the top right hand corner

2. Your API is displayed in the middle under the `Generate API Key` button. Keep this to yourself. You can reset your API key at any time.

Currently the API key for MPContribs is separate from Materials Project. In order to get your MPContribs API key.

1. Login to portal.mpcontribs.org
2. Hover over the `More` drop-down in the top right hand corner
